# Features and Functionalities

The following diagram provides a detailed visualization of the backend functional requirements for an AirBnB clone application. It serves as a blueprint for understanding the core features, technical specifications, and non-functional requirements necessary to build a robust and scalable system. 

The diagram is divided into three main sections:

- **Core Functionalities**: Highlighting the essential features that drive the application's user experience, such as user management, property listings, booking systems, and payment integration.
- **Technical Requirements**: Outlining the tools, technologies, and frameworks required to implement the backend system effectively.
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Emphasizing the importance of scalability, security, and performance to ensure a seamless and reliable application.
